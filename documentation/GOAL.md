# Project Goal

This project is an Express.js backend designed to power a Flutter application. The Flutter application will allow users to select an ending destination and the app will find the shortest route from their current device location to the destination. As the user travels through different cities, the app will provide information about the city, such as its history, culture, and landmarks.
